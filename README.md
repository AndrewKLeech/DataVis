About:
This program reads in a jpg file that contains 139 different colors.
The final version of this program should inlcude a image file which will have more colors in it.

It has three modes:
1/ Display amount of each color in the form of a bar chart
2/ Display all pixels sorted by color
3/ Display orignal image


These modes are still to be updated such as showing the amount of pixels of each color on the bar chart and fixing minor
issues with the pixel sort.
