About:
This program reads in four jpg or png files and looks at the pixels of each.
The final version of this program should inlcude a image file which will have more colors in it.

It has three modes:

1/ Display amount of each color in the form of a bar chart

2/ Display all pixels sorted by color

3/ Display orignal image


These modes are still to be updated such as showing the amount of pixels of each color on the bar chart.
