Repository for OOP assignment for data visualization 

About:
This program reads in a jpg file that contains the colors red, green, blue, black, and white.
The final version of this program should be able to read more colors and inlcuded pic.jpg file will have more colors in it in the final version.
It will read more colors when I find the best way to do so.
I also am trying to sort the pixels in the picture so that all of color 1 pixels will be printed first, then color 2 and so on.
